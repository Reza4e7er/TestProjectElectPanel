You can import a model in Maya with customized materials for Arnold.

1. Unzip all files from the archive PB114_wrench_low.zip into one folder.
(Note that PB114_wrench_low.obj file and PB114_wrench_low_Arnold.ma must be in the same folder.)
2. Make sure currently selected render is Arnold.
3. Import PB114_wrench_low_Arnold.ma into your project.

(If you import the model into the project for the first time, it will not be inserted into the scene, import the model a second time so that it is inserted into the scene)
