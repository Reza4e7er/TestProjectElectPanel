You can import a model in Maya with customized materials for RenderMan.

1. Unzip all files from the archive PB59_pliers_SM.zip into one folder.
(Note that PB59_pliers_SM.obj file and PB59_pliers_SM_RenderMan.ma must be in the same folder.)
2. Make sure currently selected render is RenderMan.
3. Import PB59_pliers_SM_RenderMan.ma into your project.

(If you import the model into the project for the first time, it will not be inserted into the scene, import the model a second time so that it is inserted into the scene)
